# Improved React Sample with JSX
JSX allows us to use XML syntax in Javascript. This is achieved via `babel` which transpiles our JSX to the more verbose `React.createElement` statements before attaching to the DOM.

## In Summary
1. We import babel via a CDN script.
1. We modify our `<script>` tag to be `type="text/babel`.
1. We replace `React.createElement` with JSX.
